      <h2>Speaker Guide</h2>

      <p>So you've decided to give a talk for our meetup &mdash; <strong>thank you</strong>! Here
        are a few things we'll need from you and some tips to get you started.</p>

      <p id="need"><em><strong>What We Need From You</strong></em></p>
      <p>We need the following information up front in order to get your talk scheduled:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The title of your talk</li>
        <li>Brief overview of the talk. Generally a paragraph or two highlighting the main things
          people can expect to learn about (not required for lightning talks).</li>
        <li>A one or two sentence bio including any contact info you'd like shared (e.g. Twitter handle)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Take a look at any of our recent <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bleeding-edge-web/">meetup
        announcements</a> for examples of how others have done this.</p>

      <p>If your slides will be hosted online (strongly preferred) please provide the link to
        us <strong>prior to the start of the meetup</strong> so that we can make them available to
        anyone watching the livestream during your talk.</p>

      <p id="slide-tips"><em><strong>Slide Tips</strong></em></p>
      <p>You will be presenting in a large room, and slides will be on monitors that may be hard to
        see for people sitting in the back. Also, while we record the slides on video, the camera is
        not close to the screen. Plan your talk with these parameters in mind.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Slides should be <strong>light text on dark background</strong>. Very light backgrounds
          wash out completely on video and negatively affect the overall video quality. This one is
          very important!</li>
        <li><strong>Font size should be large</strong>. Basically the bigger the text, the better. Favor
          more slides with less text per slide over fewer densely-populated slides when possible.</li>
        <li>Favor <strong>high contrast</strong> between text and background colors.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p id="talk-duration"><em><strong>Preparing | Talk Duration</strong></em></p>
      <p>
        We typically have the room from <b>6:30-9pm</b>. We always start off with our standing "News from the Bleeding Edge"
        talk, which takes the first 20 minutes or so. The perfect duration for the main talk is about
        <b>20-30 minutes</b>. In fact, erring on the shorter side is usually better (TED talks are <a
          href="https://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_speaker_guide.pdf">18 minutes</a>!),
          and leaves more time afterward for questions and networking.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should plan on arriving <strong>15 minutes prior to the meetup start time</strong> to get
        set up and oriented with the room. For Mac users, you can connect via Airplay. For Windows/Linux users,
        there are HDMI and VGA connection options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out some of our prior meetups on <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/user/austintechlive/search?query=bleeding+edge+web" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
        to get a good feel for how the events usually go.
