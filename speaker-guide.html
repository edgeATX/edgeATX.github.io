      <h2>Speaker Guide</h2>

      <p>So you've decided to give a talk for our meetup &mdash; <strong>thank you</strong>! Here
        are a few things we'll need from you and some tips to get you started.</p>

      <p id="need"><em><strong>What We Need From You</strong></em></p>
      <p>We need the following information up front in order to get your talk scheduled:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The title of your talk</li>
        <li>Brief overview of the talk. Generally a paragraph or two highlighting the main things
          people can expect to learn about (not required for lightning talks).</li>
        <li>A one or two sentence bio including any contact info you'd like shared (e.g. Twitter handle)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Take a look at any of our recent <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bleeding-edge-web/">meetup
        announcements</a> for examples of how others have done this.</p>

      <p>If your slides will be hosted online (strongly preferred) please provide the link to
        us <strong>prior to the start of the meetup</strong> so that we can make them available to
        anyone watching the livestream during your talk.</p>

      <p id="slide-tips"><em><strong>Slide Tips</strong></em></p>
      <p>You will be presenting in a large room, and slides will be on tv screens that may be hard to
        see for people sitting in the back. Also while we record the slides on video, the camera is
        not close to the screen. Plan your talk with these parameters in mind.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Slides should be <strong>light text on dark background</strong>. Very light backgrounds
          wash out completely on video and negatively affect the overall video quality. This one is
          very important!</li>
        <li><strong>Font size should be large</strong>. Basically the bigger the text, the better. Favor
          more slides with less text per slide over fewer densely-populated slides when possible.</li>
        <li>Favor <strong>high contrast</strong> between text and background colors.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p id="talk-duration"><em><strong>Preparing | Talk Duration</strong></em></p>
      <p>
        We have the room from <b>7-9pm</b>. You'll have at least <b>60 minutes to speak</b>, though you don't have to use it all.
        We can arrange for more time (up to ~80 minutes) if you need it. Be advised each meetup starts with our recurring segment 
        "News from the Bleeding Edge", performed by Brian and/or Corey, which is a 15-25 minute recap of what's new in 
        web technology. Sometimes lightining talks follow this segment (up to 3) before the main event (your talk).
      </p>
      <p>
        Many speakers choose to <b>arrive 15 minutes early (6:45pm)</b> to get setup and oriented with the room.
        There are multiple TV's and an overhead microphone, as well as the video camera. For macOS users, you can
        connect via Airplay. For Windows/Linux users, there is an HDMI and VGA connection. Usually we're in the main room
        on the 16th floor, where the HDMI connection can be a little finicky. Double check with the organizers beforehand,
        just in case Capital Factory needs to move the event to another space.
