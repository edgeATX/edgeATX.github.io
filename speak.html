      <p id="what"><em><strong>What to Talk About</strong></em></p>
      <p style="font-size: 65%;">If you'd like to talk but don't think you can fill up an hour, try a lightning talk (see below)!</p>
      <p>We like to discuss all things web and mobile. We've had a number of talks about Node.js,
        HTML/JavaScript/CSS, web servers, libraries & frameworks, etc. We've also had talks about
        Google Glass, Automating your home, internet of things, and others. The bottom line: if
        you think it would interest the group, it's likely a good fit.
      <p>Bleeding Edge Web is a semi-general group. Our members are interested in web technology.
        Many of our members are also entrepreneurs, job seekers, employers, developers, CTO's, students,
        and tinkerers. Lots of people means lots of interesting subjects.</p>
      <p>If you run a more focused tech meetup group
        in town, you're probably a good candidate for speaking to our group. Jumpstart your meetup
        with us, or guage interest in a subject.</p>

      <p id="lightning-talks"><em><strong>Lightning Talks</strong></em></p>
      <p>There aren't any formal guidelines for these, other than trying to keep it to ~5mins.
        Some people use 3-5 slides, some just talk. Topics can be anything of interest
        to the group. You know what the group is interested in because you're a part of
        it (what interests you?).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A project you're working on at work or for fun. (show &amp; tell)</li>
        <li>A new (or new-to-you) code library/framework that excites you. (mini-lesson)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Lightning talks in the past have covered things like Vue.js, RiotJS, functional programming,
      mobile apps, CSS Pointer Events, Node.js utilities, developer services, personal project,
      hackathons, etc.</p>

      <p id="slide-tips"><em><strong>Slide Tips</strong></em></p>
      <p>If your talk includes slides, remember that you'll be presenting in a large room on screens
        that may be hard to see for people sitting in the back. Also while we record the slides on
        video, the camera is not close to the screen, and the resolution is relatively low. Ideally
        slides should be optimized with these limitations in mind:
      <ul>
        <li>Slides should be <strong>light text on dark background</strong>. Very light backgrounds
          wash out completely on video and negatively affect the overall video quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Font size should be large</strong>. Favor more slides with less text per slide
          over fewer densely-populated slides when possible. 24px would be a good minimum size.</li>
        <li>Favor <strong>high contrast</strong> between text and background colors.</li>
        <li>As a general presentation tip, favor <strong>strong visuals over text</strong> as much
          as possible. People won't remember all the details, and can look them up later if needed.</li>
      </ul>
