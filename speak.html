      <p id="what"><em><strong>What to Talk About</strong></em></p>
      <p class="note">If you'd like to talk but don't think you can fill 30 minutes, consider
        giving a lightning talk (see below)!</p>
      <p>We like to discuss all things web + mobile. We've had a number of talks about Node.js,
        HTML/JS/CSS, web servers, libraries &amp; frameworks, etc. We've also had talks about
        Google Glass, "Internet of things", etc. Bottom line: if you think it would interest
        other web app developer types, it's likely a good fit.
      <p>Our members are generally interested in web technology, but fall into a wide spectrum.
        Many are entrepreneurs, job seekers, employers, developers, students, and tinkerers. Lots of
        people means lots of interesting subjects.</p>
      <p>If you run a tech meetup organized around a specific technology you might be a good candidate
        for speaking to our group. Overview talks about languages and franeworks generally make for
        perfect topics for our members who might not otherwise attend a meetup specific to them.</p>

      <p id="lightning-talks"><em><strong>Lightning Talks</strong></em></p>
      <p>There aren't any formal guidelines for these, other than trying to keep it to 5-10 minutes.
        Some people use 3-5 slides, some just talk. Topics can be anything of interest
        to the group. You know what the group is interested in because you're a part of
        it (what interests you?).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A project you're working on at work or for fun (show &amp; tell)</li>
        <li>A new (or new-to-you) code library/framework that excites you (mini-lesson)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Lightning talks in the past have covered things like Vue.js, RiotJS, functional programming,
      mobile apps, CSS Pointer Events, Node.js utilities, developer services, personal project,
      hackathons, etc.</p>

      <p id="speaker-guide"><em><strong>Speaker Guide</strong></em></p>
      <p>If you are ready to present at the meetup we have a <a href="./speaker-guide.html">handy speaker
        guide</a> that includes what we'll need from you and some tips that might help with your talk.</p>
