      <p><em><strong>Speaking Opportunities</strong></em></p>
      <p>Bleeding Edge Web events follow a consistent format:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Welcome &amp; Announcements</li>
        <li>Bleeding Edge Web (20-25 minutes)</li>
        <li><b>Deep Dive/Primary Talk</b> (~45min-1hr)</li>
        <li><b>Lightning Talks</b> (~3 talks @5mins/ea)</li>
        <li>Meetup formally ends by 9pm.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Many members head to a local bar for networking/socializing after the event.</em></p>

      <p><em><strong>What to Talk About</strong></em></p>
      <p style="font-size: 65%;">If you'd like to talk but don't think you can fill up an hour, try a lightning talk (see below)!</p>
      <p>We like to discuss all things web and mobile. We've had a number of talks about Node.js,
        HTML/JavaScript/CSS, web servers, libraries & frameworks, etc. We've also had talks about
        Google Glass, Automating your home, internet of things, and others. The bottom line: if
        you think it would interest the group, it's likely a good fit.
      <p>Bleeding Edge Web is a semi-general group. Our members are interested in web technology.
        Many of our members are also entrepreneurs, job seekers, employers, developers, CTO's, students,
        and tinkerers. Lots of people means lots of interesting subjects.</p>
      <p>If you run a more focused tech meetup group
        in town, you're probably a good candidate for speaking to our group. Jumpstart your meetup
        with us, or guage interest in a subject.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Lightning Talks</strong></em></p>
      <p>There aren't any formal guidelines for these, other than trying to keep it to ~5mins.
        Some people use 3-5 slides, some just talk. Topics can be anything of interest
        to the group. You know what the group is interested in because you're a part of
        it (what interests you?).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A project you're working on at work or for fun. (show & tell)</li>
        <li>A new (or new-to-you) code library/framework that excites you. (mini-lesson)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Lightning talks in the past have covered things like Vue.js, RiotJS, functional programming,
      mobile apps, CSS Pointer Events, Node.js utilities, developer services, personal project,
      hackathons, etc.</p>
