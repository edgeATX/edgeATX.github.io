      <h2>Sponsor Guide</h2>

      <p>So you've decided to sponsor our meetup &mdash; <strong>thank you</strong>! If you need
        a refresher on the pricing and details we have <a href="./sponsorship.html">a page for that</a>.
        Here are a few things we'll need from you and some tips to get you started.</p>

      <p id="need"><em><strong>What We Need From You</strong></em></p>
      <p>We need the following information as soon as possible:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your company name, website and logo for inclusion in the meetup posting. We'll use the
          logo on your site by default, but let us know if it should be something different.</li>
        <li>A brief writeup about your company, which can also include something about
          positions you are recruiting for, if applicable</li>
        <li>A contact email or twitter handle for anyone who may want to follow up with
          you after the meetup</li>
        <li>A billing contact name and email that we will use to invoice you for the sponsorship
          fee. The fee is due at the time of the meetup (or anytime earlier).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We will include a sponsor slide with your logo in our standard presentation. If
        you require something more than that let us know and we'll work with you. Feel free
        to bring business cards and/or giveaways if desired.</p>

      <p>Take a look at any of our recent <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bleeding-edge-web/">meetup
        announcements</a> for examples of other sponsor listings.</p>
