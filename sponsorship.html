      <h2>Sponsorship Opportunities</h2>

      <p>To sponsor a meetup, or if you have any questions about sponsoring, please <a
        href="mailto:bleedingedgeatx@gmail.com?subject=Sponsorship%20Inquiry">email us</a>.
      <p>We ask for $250 to cover the cost of food and drink (we typically feed 80+
        attendees). We handle all of the ordering and delivery logistics. Remaining money, if any,
        is used to offset the recurring costs of running the meetup (e.g. meetup.com fees).</p>
      <p>Alternately, you are welcome to supply your own food/drinks instead, so long as it complies
        with Capital Factory's rules. This means alcohol is OK as long as it is pre-packaged in
        cans or bottles. Open liquor is also possible, but you must provide a licensed bartender.</p>
      <p>In return, you get:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name in front of every person who receives our invitation emails (~2,400 as of
          February 2017, mostly developers in Austin)</li>
        <li>A thank you slide and mention during the Bleeding Edge Web presentation</li>
        <li>A chance to address the group in person, if desired</li>
        <li>A listing on our meetup page as a sponsor</li>
        <li>An opportunity to hand out swag, sign people up, etc.</li>
        <li>A tax write off?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a great opportunity to create some local awareness, find potential employees,
        give back to the community, and meet new people.</p>

      <p id="alternate-sponsorship"><em><strong>Alternate Sponsorship Opportunities</strong></em></p>
      <p>We've had sponsors provide giveaway items from books to stickers to physical gadgets.
        If you are interested in providing swag or giveaway items, let us know!</p>

      <p id="sponsor-guide"><em><strong>Sponsor Guide</strong></em></p>
      <p>If you are ready to sponsor the meetup we have a <a href="./sponsor-guide.html">handy sponsor
        guide</a> that includes what we'll need from you to get the sponsorship set up.</p>
