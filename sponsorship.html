      <h2>Sponsorship Opportunities</h2>

      <p>To sponsor a meetup, or if you have any questions about sponsoring, please <a
        href="mailto:bleedingedgeatx@gmail.com?subject=Sponsorship%20Inquiry">email us</a>.
      <p>We ask for <strong>$300</strong> to cover the cost of food and drink (we typically feed 80+
        attendees). We handle all of the ordering and delivery logistics. Remaining money, if any,
        is used to offset the recurring costs of running the meetup (e.g. meetup.com fees, swag, etc).</p>
      <p>Alternately, you are welcome to supply your own food/drinks instead, so long as it complies
        with Capital Factory's rules. This means alcohol is OK as long as it is pre-packaged in
        cans or bottles. Open liquor is not an option.</p>
      <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name in front of every person who receives our invitation emails (3,800+ as of
          March 2019, mostly developers in Austin)</li>
        <li>A mention on the meetup page as a sponsor</li>
        <li>A thank you slide and mention during the Bleeding Edge Web presentation</li>
        <li>A chance to address the group in person, if desired</li>
        <li>An opportunity to hand out stickers &amp; swag, sign people up, etc. We'll 
          even keep any extra swag to hand out at future meetups.</li>
        <li>A persistent sponsor link in our <a href="/slides/">talk history</a></li>
        <li>A thank you tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/edgeatx">@edgeatx</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a great opportunity to create some local awareness, find potential employees,
        give back to the community, and meet new people. And more importantly, you'll be 
        supporting local tech culture, which helps everyone!
      </p>

      <p id="alternate-sponsorship"><em><strong>Alternate Sponsorship Opportunities</strong></em></p>
      <p>We've had sponsors provide giveaway items from books to stickers to physical gadgets.
        If you are interested in providing swag or giveaway items, let us know!</p>

      <p id="sponsor-guide"><em><strong>Sponsor Guide</strong></em></p>
      <p>If you are ready to sponsor the meetup we have a <a href="./sponsor-guide.html">handy sponsor
        guide</a> that includes what we'll need from you to get the sponsorship set up.</p>
