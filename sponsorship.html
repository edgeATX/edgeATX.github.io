      <h2>Sponsorship Opportunities</h2>

      <p>To sponsor a meetup, or if you have any questions about sponsoring, please <a
        href="mailto:bleedingedgeatx@gmail.com?subject=Sponsorship%20Inquiry">email us</a>.
      <p>We ask <strong>$300</strong> to sponsor a meetup session, which covers the cost
        of food and drinks (we typically feed 50+ attendees). We handle all of the logistics.
        Remaining money, if any, is used to offset the recurring costs of running the meetup
        (e.g. website hosting, meetup.com fees, swag, etc).</p>
      <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name in front of every person who receives our invitation emails (4,200+ as of
          this writing, mostly technology workers in Austin)</li>
        <li>A mention on the meetup page as a sponsor</li>
        <li>A thank you slide and mention during the Bleeding Edge Web presentation</li>
        <li>A chance to speak to the group in person, if desired</li>
        <li>An opportunity to hand out stickers &amp; swag, sign people up, etc. We'll 
          even keep any leftover swag to hand out at future meetups.</li>
        <li>A permanent sponsor link on our <a href="/slides/">previous talks</a> page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a great opportunity to create some local awareness, find potential employees,
        give back to the community, and meet new people. And more importantly, you'll be 
        supporting local tech culture, which helps everyone!
      </p>
